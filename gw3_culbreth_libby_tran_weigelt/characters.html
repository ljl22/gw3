					<img class="image-hover" src="images/Miguel.jpg" alt="miguel" title="miguel">
					<h2 class="names">Miguel Rivera</h2>
					<p class="bio">A young boy and an aspiring musician. Despite the fact that his fascination with music puts him at odds with his family, he loves all of them dearly. He accidentally stumbles upon the Land of the Dead after trying to "borrow" Ernesto de la Cruz's guitar, and now needs to get back to the world of the living before sunrise.</p>
				</figure>

				<figure>
					<img class="image-hover" src="images/dante.jpg" alt="dante" title="dante">
					<h2 class="names">Dante</h2>
					<p class="bio">A goofy Mexican hairless stray dog that follows Miguel around. When Miguel is sent to the land of the dead, he manages to cross over and help Miguel find his family. Dante is not the sharpest tool in the shed, with his silliness and constant energy providing much of the film's comic relief.</p>
				</figure>

				<figure>
					<img class="image-hover" src="images/hector.jpg" alt="hector" title="hector">
					<h2 class="names">Hector Rivera</h2>
					<p class="bio">A disheveled inhabitant of the Land of the Dead who no one has left an offering for, leaving him unable to cross over to the world of the living. He claims to know Ernesto de la Cruz and strikes a deal with Miguel to take him to meet him in exchange of Miguel placing his picture on his family offering so he can visit the Land of the Living.</p>
				</figure>

				<figure>
					<img class="image-hover" src="images/ernesto.jpg" alt="ernesto" title="ernesto">
					<h2 class="names">Ernesto De La Cruz</h2>
					<p class="bio">Miguel's idol and a famous singer/guitarist/actor born in the same town as Miguel. His past has personal ties with Miguel's great-great-grandfather. Ernesto only became the star he was after he murdered HÃ©ctor and stole his songs.</p>
				</figure>

				<figure>
					<img class="image-hover" src="images/mamacoco.jpg" alt="mamacoco" title="mamacoco">
					<h2 class="names">Mama Coco</h2>
					<p class="bio">Miguel's great-grandmother and Elena's mother. She is wheelchair bound and can barely move. Due to her advanced age she sometimes mistakes her family members for one another, but she is still is Miguel's favorite playmate and in her brief moments of lucidity still mentions how much she misses her dad.</p>
				</figure>

				<figure>
					<img class="image-hover" src="images/abuelita.jpg" alt="abuelita" title="abuelita">
					<h2 class="names">Abuelita</h2>
					<p class="bio">The current matron of the family, the grandmother of Miguel, and the ultimate enforcer of the Rivera family's ban on music. She loves her family very much and will do anything to protect them. But when she gets angry, she wields a mean slipper.</p>
				</figure>

				<figure>
					<img class="image-hover" src="images/enrique.jpg" alt="enrique" title="enrique">
					<h2 class="names">Enrique Rivera</h2>
					<p class="bio">The father of Miguel Rivera and son of Elena Rivera. He adheres to the family tradition of banning music, but he knows that Elena's efforts to uphold the ban to the point of destroying Miguel's guitar understandably is too much. Enrique continues the Riveras' generation-long stance against music. But like Elena, he doesn't do so out of malice.</p>
				</figure>

				<figure>
					<img class="image-hover" src="images/luisa.jpg" alt="luisa" title="luisa">
					<h2 class="names">Luisa Rivera</h2>
					<p class="bio">Miguel's mother, she's pregnant with her second child for most of the film. Like the rest of the Riveras, Luisa wants Miguel to follow the family's shoemaking business instead of being a musician.</p>
